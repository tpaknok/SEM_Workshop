# Structural Equation Modelling Workshop

This is a 2-hour Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) workshop for the Cadotte Lab. A simulated dataset will be used to introduce the concept. A real world dataset from [Lee et al. (2023)](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2745.14109) is provided and students can build their own SEM.

This figure is extracted from Lee et al (2023).

# Goals

After the workshop, you should...
1) understand the basics of regression and SEM
2) interpret the outputs from R package [piecewiseSEM](https://github.com/jslefche/piecewiseSEM)
3) able to build simple SEMs for real world dataset.
